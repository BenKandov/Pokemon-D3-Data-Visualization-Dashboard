# cse332Final

This visualization utilizes D3.js to create a dashboard of Pokemon graphed in variety of ways/perspectives/methods. Data processing was done in Python (Pandas and scipy). Users can select and filter out graphs and corresponding points (to the same Pokemon) will be filtered on other graphs on the page.

I made it for my Data Visualization class.

It's hosted on my website:
